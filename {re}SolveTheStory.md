The year is 2200 and the last bitcoin has been mined since 60 years. 
The world is in a state of profound decadence and desolation. 
Governament and interational organizaiton have fallen and Martial law is actually on Earth.
Human beings have not being able to organize only with in an anoarco-capitalistic way. 
The new prophet that all worship is Satoshi and the new religion is not based on 
Love and Virtue but on Money, Energy and Work. 
The church is the Chain and reverse is True...
People race against time to get some fee because this is the only way they can survive. 
The world has lost his most beauful flowers, some of his rivers all lakes are gone.
It is sandy outside and the atmoshpere remembers that one of the Egyptian era where pharaons commanded slaves to build pyramids for the afterlife. 
Now, everyone is a slave of time expect the lucky one that mined firsts blocks onchain.
Not even narrative can be pushed because now zero trust word is the only law that human follow..  
Alice seems to be one of the very few that still keep wondering looking at clouds and the last eagles that flew the sky, looking at what remains of a rusty infrastrucre, the last resort of what resemble to be an oasis in the desert. She enjoys books and listen to ancient music that talks about the generation of the 70s. 
But wandering and wondering about the current affair around the world make her lost the key to the wallet of her Starkard. 
Starkard is a smart card that allow people to transact cryptographical token and verify stark proof directly on the little chip inside the card. Humans have achieve that by discovering new technique of computation. Previously, by running them on big scale clusters of ZKaccellerators and then, on implementing the circuit on a tiny chip.
If satoshi itself would have seen that when he sent the first transaction he woudn't have believed it and maybe knowing the impact of his creation on people she woudn't even sent it but he was human after all and as all of us he could predict the consequence of his action only to an extend.. 
Alice has only two ways two recover her key that will allow her get access to the starKard so she can continue to survives and dreams in her world of reality. 
The first method she has at her disposal is replying to 3 question that has benn set time ago on the starknet blockchain. The only condition is that she has to do it before the song end.
If she doesn' t remember the key she can contact 3 choosen guardians that will help her reconstruct the key through a social recovery mechanism called Shamir Secret sharing. 
Will she able to reconstruct her lost key and continue to dream?

This is just a toy exploration made learning about stark technology after i've heard a podcast of mr Ben Sasson. i ve been impressed by his love for integrity quoting Lewis Carroll.
I decided to try learn a bit and this is the result. I'm not trying to virtue signaling, the project is basic and there are for sure bugs. 
It was quite a fun experience solving part of the puzzle i have about cryptographic proof, at least in my mind more then the code.
If you want to try the front-end you should find it at zeroknowledge.lol 
You should be able to log as alice and there are hints for 2 of the 3 questions.
There should be even the guardian part where alice can contact her mum, her best friend or her boyfriend and she then have to reconstruct her key with 2 out of 3 guardians 
The cairo contracts are 2 provided as a learning example.
I'd like to explore further STARKTech but time is a finite resource and i'm slow at implementing stuff. 
If you need info about me you can write a Telegram at simone1371991.
Particular thanks to Omar for the patience with the zoom calls. 
I leave a cool quote that at least to me seem appropriate for the project 
¬´Nomina si nescis, perit et cognitio rerum.¬ª
Really Hope the best for yall. You seem like a nice community ü´£üü†‚úåüèª 
Work in progress..
